# # introduction to logic

# # logical expressions are statements that computes True or False


#comparion operators 

# # a = 2 + 2
# # b = 4

# # print(a == b)

# a = 0
# b = 1
# c = 1

# # a is equal b
# print(a == b)

# # a is not equal b
# print(a != b)

# # a is greater than b
# print(a > b)

# # a is less than b 
# print(a < b)

# # b is greater than or equal to c 
# print(b >= c)

# # b is less than or equal to c
# print(b <= c)

# print(True == 1)
# print(False == 0)
# print(True == 1.0 )
# print(False > 0)

# a = 'cat'
# b = 'cat'
# c = 'CAT'

# print(a == b)
# print (a == c)
# print(a > c) 

# logical operators

# or- at least one of the comparasions have to be true for it to return True
# print(2 < 3 or 4 < 3) # first comparsion is true

# print(2 > 3 or 4 > 3) # second comparsion is true

# print(2 > 3 or 4 < 3) # neither are true 

# print( 2 < 3 or 4 > 3) # both are true


#  and - all of the comparisions have to be true
# print(2 < 3 and 4 < 3)
# print(2 > 3 and 4 > 3)
# print(2 > 3 and 4 < 3)
# print( 2 < 3 and 4 > 3)

# print(True and False )
# print(False and True)
# print(False and False)
# print(True and True)

# not - reverse whatever Boolean value is produced by a logical expression
# print(not 2 < 3 )
# print(not True)
# print(not False)
# print(not 4 < 3)

# a = 1
# b = 10
# print(a < 10 and not b > 10)

# x = 5
